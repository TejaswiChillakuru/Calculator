# Shared calculator application

run command:
npm install
npm start


Description:

web app which logs calculations as they happen and shares those calculations with everyone connected to the app.
For example, user A and user B go to your app at the same time. User A calculates “5 + 5”, which equals “10". This is logged below the calculator as “5 + 5 = 10”. User B is updated about this calculation right after user A posts it. Now, user B calculates “3 x 4".This calculates to “12” and displays “3 x 4=12" right below the prior calculation. User A sees this update immediately after user B posts it.
